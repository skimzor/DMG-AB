# DMG Audio Board

"Reverse engineered" an original DMG Audio Board and recreated it in KiCad.

# Ordering

Upload the gerber to a PCB fab (JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSHPark) with a board thickness of 1.2mm and in your favorite color.  Then transfer the components from an original DMG Audio Board (verify the correct polarity of the capacitors is correct when transferring).  

# Disclaimer

I have not personally tested these as they were made for a member of the Game Boy community so please use at your own risk.
