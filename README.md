# DMG Audio Board

"Reverse engineered" an original DMG Audio Board and recreated it in KiCad.

Upload the gerber to a PCB fab in your favorite color and then transfer the components from the original DMG Audio Board.

I have not personally tested these as they were made for a member of the Game Boy community so please use at your own risk.
